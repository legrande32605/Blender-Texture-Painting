# Steps to Start Modeling the Tower
## Working on lower section of tower
- Loop cut across all four faces (fact0r .15)
- Select middle 2 faces in lower half
- extrude (0.18)
- Move upper right edge x 0.5 y 0.5 z -0.1
- Move upper left edge x -.02 y -0.007 z -0.15
- Round outer edges of stone with edge slide (0.1 / -0.1)
- Knife cut a triangle from the side quad (lower) from middle of the front edge to about 1/4 the way back on the top edge
- Select lower side face recently cut
- extrude (0.2)
- Round outer edges of stone with edge slide (-0.1)  Top first then 2 sides together.  Moved left vertex of top side Z -0.05
- Select top face 
- Move Z -0.12
- Bisect the upper half of the lower with Z 0.9
- Select 4 new upper faces.
- Extrude 0.12
- Scale Z 0.65
- Apply Mirrors
- Fiddling with shapes to make it unique
